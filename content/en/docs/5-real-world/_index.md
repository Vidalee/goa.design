Building production-ready APIs requires more than just defining endpoints and 
handling requests. This section covers essential aspects of building reliable, 
maintainable, and secure APIs with Goa.

## Overview

The chapters in this section walk you through the key aspects of production API 
development with Goa:

- Error handling strategies that maintain clean separation between domain and 
  transport concerns
- Comprehensive observability setup to understand your API's behavior in production
- Common implementation patterns that solve real-world API requirements
- Security implementations from basic authentication to OAuth2, along with best 
  practices

## Getting Started

If you're new to building production APIs with Goa, we recommend following these 
chapters in order as each builds on concepts from previous chapters. However, if 
you're looking to implement specific functionality, each section is also designed to 
stand alone.

Remember that security should be considered at every step, not just in the security 
chapters. The security best practices chapter provides guidelines that apply across 
all aspects of your API implementation.

[Error Handling](./1-error-handling/) to learn how to handle problems gracefully
in your API.
