# Basic gRPC Service

Goa isn’t just for RESTful APIs—it also makes **gRPC** development seamless. This tutorial series guides you through:

1. **Designing gRPC Services**  
   Use the Goa DSL to define protobuf services, methods, payloads, and errors.

2. **Implementing the Service**  
   See how to generate gRPC stubs, implement your business logic, and keep transport concerns separate.

3. **Testing with gRPC**  
   Learn to verify your service with the gRPC CLI or other tools, ensuring everything works end-to-end.

By following these steps, you’ll create a **fully functional** gRPC service while enjoying all the benefits of Goa’s **design-first** approach and **code generation** workflow.
