## Let's Build Something Amazing!

This tutorial series walks you through building a complete concert management
REST API using Goa's design-first approach. You'll learn to create endpoints
for listing, creating, updating, and deleting concerts while maintaining clean
separation of concerns and following REST conventions.

The tutorial demonstrates Goa's approach to:
- **Design-first development** with type-safe API specifications
- **Automatic validation** that happens before your business logic runs
- **Consistent error handling** across all endpoints
- **Pagination** for handling large datasets
- **Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation** that stays current
- **Strong typing** that catches issues at compile time

> **ðŸ“š Working Example**: This tutorial uses the same code as the
> [concerts example](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/main/concerts)
> in the official Goa examples repository. You can reference the complete
> working code at any time.

By the end, you'll have hands-on experience building production-ready REST APIs
with Goa's powerful design-first approach.
