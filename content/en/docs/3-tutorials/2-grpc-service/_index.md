description: "Build a complete gRPC service using Goa's design-first approach, covering service design, implementation, protobuf handling, and deployment of a concert management system."

Learn how to build a production-ready gRPC service with Goa through this comprehensive tutorial series. We'll create a concert management system that demonstrates key gRPC concepts while following Goa's design-first approach.

## Tutorial Sections

### 1. [Designing the Service](./1-designing)
Create your service definition using Goa's DSL:
- Define service methods and RPCs
- Create protocol buffer messages
- Set up input validation
- Document your service behavior

### 2. [Implementing the Service](./2-implementing)
Transform your design into working code:
- Generate service scaffolding
- Implement business logic
- Add error handling
- Set up the gRPC server

### 3. [Running the Service](./3-running)
Deploy and test your service:
- Start the gRPC server
- Make RPC calls
- Verify method behavior
- Use gRPC reflection

### 4. [Working with Protobuf](./4-serialization)
Handle protocol buffer messages:
- Message serialization
- Type mapping
- Custom field options
- Streaming data
