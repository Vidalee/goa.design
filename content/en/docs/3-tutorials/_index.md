# Goa Core Tutorials

Explore Goa's **core features** through these step-by-step tutorials, each focusing on a common API development scenario. By following along, you'll gain hands-on experience with the **Goa design-first approach**, **generated code**, **transport layers**, **error handling**, **streaming**, and more.

## Tutorial Overview

1. **Basic REST API**  
   Learn how to create a simple REST service using Goa's DSL. You'll define endpoints, generate code, implement the business logic, then test and run the finished service.

2. **Basic gRPC Service**  
   Extend your knowledge with gRPC. Discover how to define protobuf-like services in the Goa DSL, generate stubs, and test gRPC endpoints with standard tools.

3. **Error Handling**  
   Dive into Goa's robust error handling capabilities. Map errors to specific HTTP or gRPC responses, validate payloads, and keep your APIs consistent and transparent for clients.

4. **Streaming**  
   See how Goa supports streaming for server-side, client-side, and bidirectional data flows. Explore the intricacies of partial responses, long-running requests, and error handling in streaming contexts.

5. **Static Content & Files**  
   Discover how to serve static assets or single-page apps (SPA) alongside your APIs. Manage file uploads, handle templates, and integrate with common frontend use cases.
