# Welcome to Goa

This section introduces you to **Goa**, a design-first framework for building robust microservices and APIs in Go.

## What You'll Learn

- **What is Goa?**  
  A quick definition of Goa's design-first approach, how it reduces boilerplate, and what makes it different from other Go frameworks.

- **Why Goa? (vs. other frameworks)**  
  An overview of the benefits Goa provides for microservices—like code generation, transport-agnostic design, and maintainability—as well as how it compares to popular frameworks such as Gin, Echo, or raw gRPC.

- **Core Concepts**  
  A high-level look at Goa's primary building blocks (services, methods, the DSL), how Goa separates your transport logic (HTTP, gRPC) from your business logic, and how error handling, interceptors (middleware), and client generation fit into the bigger picture.

## Why Start Here?

- If you're new to Goa, this section gives you the **foundational knowledge** you need before diving into **installation** and **hands-on tutorials**.
- By understanding Goa's main ideas and advantages, you'll get the most out of the subsequent **Getting Started** and **Core Tutorials** sections.
