## Goa Endpoint

The endpoint abstraction represents a single RPC method in your service. An
endpoint may be created server side to represent a method that the service
implements, or client side to represent a method that the client calls. In both
cases, an endpoint can be represented by the `goa.Endpoint` function.

## Endpoint Client

Continuing with our `calc` example: Goa generates a transport-agnostic client
struct in `gen/calc/client.go`. This struct contains the client-side endpoints
and provides typed methods to make service requests. The generated client code
looks like this:

```go
// Client is the "calc" service client.
type Client struct {
        MultiplyEndpoint goa.Endpoint
        AddEndpoint      goa.Endpoint
}

// NewClient initializes a "calc" service client given the endpoints.
func NewClient(multiply, add goa.Endpoint) *Client {
        return &Client{
                AddEndpoint:      add,
                MultiplyEndpoint: multiply,
        }
}

// Add calls the "add" endpoint of the "calc" service.
func (c *Client) Add(ctx context.Context, p *AddPayload) (res int, err error) {
        var ires any
        ires, err = c.AddEndpoint(ctx, p)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        return ires.(int), nil
}

// Multiply calls the "multiply" endpoint of the "calc" service.
func (c *Client) Multiply(ctx context.Context, p *MultiplyPayload) (res int, err error) {
        var ires any
        ires, err = c.MultiplyEndpoint(ctx, p)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        return ires.(int), nil
}
```

The client struct contains two fields, `AddEndpoint` and `MultiplyEndpoint`, which
represent the client-side endpoints for the `add` and `multiply` methods. The
`NewClient` function initializes the client struct with the provided endpoints.

The transport-specific code generated by Goa includes factory methods that create
endpoints for the transport layer. These factory methods are used to initialize
the client struct with the appropriate endpoints.

See the [HTTP](./5-http.md) and [gRPC](./6-grpc.md) sections for more information
about the transport-specific client implementations.
