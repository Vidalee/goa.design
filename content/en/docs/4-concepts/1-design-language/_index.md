Learn about Goa's Design Language (DSL), a powerful domain-specific language
that revolutionizes API design. The DSL is the cornerstone of Goa's approach to
service development, offering a unique blend of simplicity and sophistication
that sets it apart from traditional API development methods.

## Why Goa's DSL?

Goa's DSL empowers you to express your service design in a clear, declarative
way while enforcing best practices and maintaining consistency. It acts as a
single source of truth for your entire API, automatically generating everything
from documentation to server code to client SDKs.

Key benefits include:

* **Type Safety**: Define your types once, use them everywhere with complete confidence
* **Contract-First Design**: Focus on your API's design before diving into implementation details
* **Automatic Validation**: Get built-in request and response validation without writing boilerplate
* **Code Generation**: Transform your designs into production-ready code with a single command
* **Living Documentation**: Keep your API documentation always in sync with your implementation

## Getting Started

The DSL is organized into logical sections that guide you through the API design process:

* Start with [Data Modeling](./1-data-modeling) to define your service's types and structures
* Learn about [Service Design](./2-services) to specify endpoints and their behaviors
* Explore [Security](./3-security) to implement authentication and authorization
* Master [Error Handling](./4-error-handling) for robust API responses

Whether you're building a simple REST API or a complex microservices
architecture, Goa's DSL provides the tools and abstractions you need to create
professional, production-ready services.
